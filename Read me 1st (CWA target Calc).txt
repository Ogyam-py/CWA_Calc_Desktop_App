Guess what?
Let assume you currently have a CWA of 67% as a second year student, and
you are hoping to get CWA of 72%.

The question is...
What is the minimum score you need to get in each course to achieve your target?
I guess you are assuming 75 plus.

Well, A second year student with a cummulative credit of about 53
and a current semester credit of about 18 would need 86.72% per course to make a CWA of 72%.

THE MATHEMATICS BEHIND THE COMPUTATIONS
=========================================
CWA TARGET = 72%
CURRENT CWA = 67%
CUMMULATIVE CREDITS = 53  (This does not include any semester with unpublished results)
SEMESTER CREDITS = 18 (This refers to your current or awaiting semester results)

Let assume that in every subject you got "t" percent.
Then the equation becomes

CWA TARGET=[(CUMMULATIVE CREDITS x CURRENT CWA) + (SEMESTER CREDITS x t)] / (CUMMULATIVE CREDITS + SEMESTER CREDITS)

72 = (53x67 + 18t)/(53 + 18)
t= [72(53 + 18)-(53x67)]/18
t= 86.72%

NB: The student is required to obtain 86.72% per cousre to achieve his/her target
Your scores for each subject may vary therefore as you drop below 86.&2% for a course then you need to increase above
86.72% in other course relative to the credit hours of the courses.
